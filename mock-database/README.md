# Mock-Database

This is the readme for the mock-database project

## Passwords

Passwords are defined as `password_agent_id` or `password_client_id`.  
These passwords are stored as hashes in the database so there is no other way to figure it out.  
For example, a client with an id of `1` has a password of `password_client_1`
